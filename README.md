## Description

`deep4downscaling` is a Python library designed for developing deep learning models for statistical downscaling. The library focuses on two main objectives:

**Ease of Research**:
`deep4downscaling` provides a suite of standard techniques essential for the statistical downscaling field, such as:

- Data Preprocessing 
- Data transformations
- Standardization and Normalization

By offering these foundational methods, researchers can focus on innovative tasks such as novel architecture development, rather than re-implementing standard routines from scratch.

**Established Deep Learning Models**:
`deep4downscaling` also supplies established deep learning models that can be used to downscale global climate model outputs. Beyond the models themselves, the library provides:

- Tools to compute and generate projections (ensuring compatibility with standard climate data formats like NetCDF).
- Scripts for proper post-processing (e.g., bias correction, domain mapping).

In addition to these main goals, `deep4downscaling` includes:

**Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**:
A dedicated collection of evaluation metrics widely recognized in the downscaling community, enabling researchers to thoroughly assess model performance.

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bias_mean` | Bias of the mean between the target and predicted datasets. |
| `bias_tnn` | Bias of the annual minimum of daily minimum temperature (TNn). |
| `bias_txx` | Bias of the annual maximum of daily maximum temperature (TXx). |
| `bias_quantile` | Bias of a specified quantile. |
| `mae` | Mean Absolute Error (MAE). |
| `rmse` | Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). |
| `rmse_wet` | RMSE for wet days only. |
| `rmse_relative` | RMSE relative to the target's standard deviation. |
| `bias_rel_mean` | Relative bias of the mean. |
| `bias_rel_quantile` | Relative bias of a specified quantile. |
| `bias_rel_R01` | Relative bias of the wet-day frequency index (R01). |
| `bias_rel_dry_days` | Relative bias of the proportion of dry days. |
| `bias_rel_SDII` | Relative bias of the wet-day intensity index (SDII). |
| `bias_rel_rx1day` | Relative bias of the maximum 1-day precipitation index (Rx1day). |
| `ratio_std` | Ratio of standard deviations. |
| `ratio_interannual_var` | Ratio of interannual variability. |
| `corr` | Pearson or Spearman correlation, with an option for deseasonalized data. |
| `joint_quantile_exceedance` | Joint exceedance probability for a given quantile for two variables. |
| `bias_joint_quantile_exceedance` | Bias in the joint quantile exceedance probability. |
| `diurnal_temp_range` | Diurnal temperature range (DTR). |
| `bias_diurnal_temp_range` | Bias in the diurnal temperature range. |
| `corr_compound` | Pearson or Spearman correlation between two different variables. |
| `bias_corr_compound` | Bias in the correlation between two different variables. |
| `crps_ensemble` | Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for an ensemble forecast. |
| `normalized_rank` | Normalized Rank for an ensemble forecast. |

**eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Techniques Tailored for Downscaling**:
XAI techniques adapted for statistical downscaling models. This ensures that generated projections are transparent and trustworthy—a critical feature for decision-makers and other end-users who rely on climate modeling outputs.

By combining core data transformations, established deep learning models, advanced evaluation metrics, and explainable AI, `deep4downscaling` aims to empower the research community to develop and validate cutting-edge downscaling solutions with greater efficiency and confidence.
